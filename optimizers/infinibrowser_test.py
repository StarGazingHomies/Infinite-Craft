# TODO: Make an optimization generation algorithm that
# does EVERYTHING at once in O(e) time where e = # of edges
# Or maybe n log(e) or maybe elog(n) if I can get better accuracy
# Does not have to be that good, but it has to be fast

# Sketch
# Generate generations - O(e)
# For each generation, look at the elements and make a tentative recipe considering each recipe - O(e)
